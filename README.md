# 🎵 Beocreate Remote 🎚️

This is a small app, (in fact my first mobile app in DotNet MAUI, so be gentle ), to control the soundboard [HifiBerry Beocreate](https://www.hifiberry.com/beocreate/) on top of a Raspberry Pi.

## HowTo

The app has been made to work with the [dsptoolkit](https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-dsp/) installed on top of [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/) .
